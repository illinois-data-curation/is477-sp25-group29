# Project plan

## Overview

The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between unemployment rates and housing prices in the United States over the past 10 years (2012-2022). By integrating unemployment data from FRED and housing price data from Kaggle, the project aims to determine whether fluctuations in unemployment rates have a significant impact on housing market trends. The insights from this project can help policymakers, economists, and real estate professionals understand the potential economic implications of labor market changes on housing affordability and investment.

## Research question: What is/are the question(s) you intend to address?

How do changes in unemployment rate affect housing prices in the United States for the past 10 years?

## Team Roles and Responsibilities

As the sole team member, all tasks related to data collection, cleaning, analysis, documentation, and project management will be handled b| Han Huynh. The project will be managed using a structured timeline and a version-controlled repository for reproducibility.

## Data Acquisition and Integration

- Gathering U.S. unemployment rate data from FRED using an API key

- Retrieving housing price data from Kaggle

- Validating data consistency and integrity across different sources

- Combining datasets using Python to ensure proper time alignment

## Data Profiling and Cleaning

- Conducting initial checks for data completeness

- Identifying and addressing missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies

- Standardizing date formats and ensuring structural uniformity

- Handling outliers and filling data gaps

## Data Analysis and Visualization

- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns

- Assessing potential correlations between unemployment rates and housing prices

- Developing visual representations such as line charts, scatter plots, and regression models to illustrate findings

## Feature Engineering and Model Development

- Extracting meaningful features from the dataset

- Building predictive models to evaluate relationships between key variables

- Assessing model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics

- Iteratively refining models based on findings from initial tests

## Documentation

- Maintaining structured Markdown documentation for all project stages

- Preparing reports, including the project plan, interim status report, and final report

- Recording assumptions, data sources, and methodological decisions

- Properly citing all data and tools used

## GitHub and Workflow Automation

- Keeping a well-structured GitHub repository

- Ensuring clear, version-controlled, and well-documented commits

- Automating data acquisition, integration, and analysis processes using Python

- Archiving the final project in a public repository for reproducibility

## Identifying and Describing Datasets:

The project will use two key datasets:

1. U.S. Unemployment Rate Data (FRED API)

    - Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)

    - Contains monthly unemployment rates for the U.S. from 2012 to 2022

    - Data will be retrieved using an API key and stored as a CSV file for analysis

2. U.S. Housing Prices Data (Kaggle)

    - Source: [Kaggle dataset on housing prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tiffanytong0321/housepriceandmortgage?resource=download.)

    - Includes data on home prices, mortgage rates, and economic indicators

    - Data spans from 2012 to 2022 and will be downloaded manually for integration

Both datasets are publicly available, ensuring that there are no restrictions on their use for research purposes.

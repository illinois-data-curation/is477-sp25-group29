## Summary:
### Project Overview:
This project investigates the relationship between mortgage rates, consumer price index (CPI), and housing prices in the United States over the past decade. Housing prices are a critical economic indicator, reflecting household wealth, affordability, and broader economic conditions. Understanding the impact of mortgage rates and inflation on housing prices is vital for policimakers, investors, and consumers to make informed decisions.

The analysis leverages two datasets:
1. Historical housing prices from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)
2. 30-year fixed mortgage rates

The goal is to assess how fluctuations in mortgage rates and inflation (proxied by CPI) influence changes in housing prices. This analysis combines statistical methods, data integration, and visualizations to offer meaningful insights

### Motivation: 
The motivation for this research arises from the significant role housing markets play in the broader economy. Housing prices are affected by numerous factors, including interest rates, inflation, and economic stability. Mortgage rates, which determine the cost of borrowing for prospective homeowners, are especially influential. Simultaneously, inflation purchasing power, potentially impacting demand for real estate. 

The project address the following key questions:
- How do mortgage rates affect housing prices in the U.S. over the past decade?
- What is the role of inflation (via CPI) in influencing housing prices?
- Can statistical analysis quantify these relationships and identify trends or patterns?

By exploring these questions, the project contributes to a deeper understanding of the housing market dynamics.

### Research questions
1. How do changes in mortgage rates affect housing prices in the United States over the last 10 years?
2. How does inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), impact housing prices over the same period?
3. Are these relationships statistically significant, and can they be visualized through trends or predictive models?

### Methodology
1. Data integration: 
- Two datasets were programmatically merged using Python and Pandas. The FHFA housing price index and the 30-year mortgage rate were aligned by date.
- CPI data was incorporated to reflect inflationary effects.
- Data cleaning included handling missing values, standardizing formats, and ensuring aligment across datasets
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationship between variables.
- Line plots and scatter plots were used to identify trends over time.
3. Statistical Analysis:
- A linear regression model was implemented to quantify the impact of mortgage rates on housing prices.
- CPI was included as an additional explanatory variable to evaluate it influence.
4. Visualizations:
- Heatmap highlighted the strengthe and directions of correlations.
- Time-series graphs illustrated rends in housing prices, mortgage rates, and CPI.
5. Reproducible Workflow:
- The entire analysis was automated using Snakemake to ensure reproducibility. Scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization were modular and scalable.

### Findings
1. Correlation:
- A negative correlation was observed between mortgage rates and housing prices, indicating that higher borrowing costs tend to reduce demand for housing
- A positive correlation was noted between CPI and housing prices, suggesting that inflationary pressures drive up real estate values.
2. Regression Analysis:
- The regression model revealed that mortgage rates had a statistically insignificant effect on housing prices. The R^2 score was only 0.0043
- CPI exhibited a positive and significant effect, with a R^2 score of 0.98.
3. Trends:
- Housing prices showed a steady upward trend over the past decade, with periods of sharp increased corresponding to historically low mortgage rates.
- Rising inflation in recent years has coincided with accelerated growth in housing prices, emphasizing its influence.

### Conclusion

This project highlights the critical interplay between mortgage rates, inflation, and housing prices. The findings suggest that mortgage rates and inflation are significant drivers of housing prices, aligning with economic theory. When mortgage rates are low, housing becomes more affordable, driving up demand and prices. Conversely, inflation erodeds purchasing power but also increases asset values, including real estate.

The automoated workflow and reproducible framework ensure that this analysis can be extended with new data or additional variables. Future research could incorporate broader datasets, such as regional housing prices or unemployment rates, to refine these findings.

this study provides valuable insights for policy makers, financial institutions, and real estate stakeholders, enabling better decision-making in the context of housing market dynamics.

## Findings

This project examined the relationship between U.S. housing prices, mortgage rates, and inflation (measured by the CPI) over the last decade (2012-2022). Using datasets from Kaggle and FRED (source: Federal Housing Finance Agency, Freddie Mac, and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics), statistical analysis and visualizations were employed to derive insights. Below is a summary of the findings.

### Key Observations
1. Trend analysis:
- Housing prices consistently rose over the decade, with an especially steep increase after 2020.
- Mortgage rates fluctuated significantly, with a prolonged period of low rates during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021), followed by increases in 2022.
- The Consumer Price Index (CPI) steadily increased over the decade, reflecting persistent inflationary pressures, with a sharp rise starting in 2021.
2. Correlation Analysis:
- A very weak negative correlation (-0.07) was observed between mortgage rates and housing prices. This suggests that changes in mortgage rates alone have minimal direct impact on housing prices during the observed period.
- A strong positive corrleation (0.99) was found between CPI and housing prices, indicating a nearly linear relationship. As inflation increased, housing prices rose significantly, possibly reflecting inflation's effect on the cost of constuction and the role of real estate as an inflation hedge.

### Regression Analysis

Two separate linear regression models were built to analyze the relationship between housing prices and the independent variables (mortgage rates and CPI). The results are as follows:
1. Model 1: Housing Prices vs. Mortgage Rates
- R^2 value: 0.0043
    - The model explains less than 1% of the variance in housing prices. Mortgage rates have a negligible predictive value for housing prices.
2. Model 2: Housing Prices vs. CPI
- R^2 value: 0.9837
    - The model explains 98.37% of the variance in housing prices, indicating an extremely strong fit.

### Visualizations
1. Time-Series trends:
- Line charts of housing prices, mortgage rates, and CPI showed:
    - A weak association between mortgage rate fluctuations and housing price trends.
    - A strong alignment between CPI and housing prices, particularly during periods of high inflation.
![Time-Series trends](results/Visualizations.png)
2. Scatter plots:
- Scatter plot of mortgage rates vs. housing prices revealed a nearly flat trend line, reflecting the weak correlation.
- Scatter plot of CPI vs. housing prices showed a clear upward trend, emphasizing their strong positive relatioship

3. Heatmap:
- The correlation heatmap visually highlighted the negligible relationship between mortgage rates and housing prices and the near-perfect correlation between CPI and housing prices
![Heat map](results/Correlation_heatmap.png)
### Findings Summary
1. Mortgage Rates and Housing Prices:
Despite theoretical expectations of a negative relationship, the analysis indicates that mortgage rates had little direct impact on housing prices over the past decade. This could be attributed to other factors, such as strong housing demand, supply constraints, and low inventory, which overshadowed changes in financing costs.
2. Inflation (CPI) and Housing Prices:
The nearly linear relationship between CPI and housing prices underscore the significant influence of inflation on housing costs. Rising prices for materials, labor, and land likely contributed to the observed trends. Additionally, real estate's function as an inflation hedge likely drove demand, furhter amplifying price increases.
3. Broader Implications:
The findings suggest that inflation is a far more dominant factor in driving housing price changes than mortgage rates. Policymakers and investors should prioritize inflationary trends when assessing the housing market.

### Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates that while mortgage rates have minimal power for housing price trends, inflation (CPI) plays a critical role. The findings align with economic theory regarding inflation and its effects on asset prices. Future research could investigate additional variables, such as regional disparities, wage growth, and housing supply, to gain a deeper understanding of these dynamics.

## Future Work

This project explored the relationship between U.S. housing prices, mortgage rates, and inflation over the last decade (2012-2022). While the findings were insightful, several challenges and limitations emerged, offering valuable lessons and opportunities for future work. Below is a discussion of these lessons and potential avenues for extending the research.

### Lessons Learned
1. Data Integration Challenges

Combinding datasets from multiple source required significant preprocessing, such as aligning time intervals and resolving missing data. this step emphasized the importance of a systematic approach to data cleaning and integration. Automating this process using tools like Snakemake provided efficiency, but issues with software setup highlighted the need for robust development environments and user-friendly automation tools.

2. Complexity of Housing Market Dynamics

The weak correlation between mortgage rates and housing prices suggests that housing market trends are influenced by numerous factors beyond macroeconomic indicators. These factors may include housing supply, local market conditions, consumer behavior, and governmental policies. Simplistic models may fail to capture the intricacies of these interactions, underscoring the need for multifactorial analyses.

3. Impact of Inflation

The strong correlation between CPI and housing prices highlighted inflation's significant role in real estate markets. However, it also raised questions about causation versus correlation. While inflation likely impacts housing prices, reverse causality or mutual influences from other variables, such as wage growth or monetary policy, cannot be ruled out.

4. Model limitations

Linear regression models provided a starting point but were limited in capturing non-linear relationships and interaction effects. Additionally, the extremely high R^2 value for the CPI model suggested possible overfitting, warranting caution in interpreting results.

### Potential Future Work
1. Incorporating Additional Variables

Future studies could enhance the analysis by including more granular data:
- Regional data: Housing prices, mortgage rates, and CPI can vary significantly by state or metropolitan area. Regional analysis would allow for deeper insights into local housing market dynamics
- Supply-side Factors: Variables such as housing inventory, new construction rates, and zoning regulations could shed light on supply constraints affecting prices
- Demographic Trends: Population growth, migration patterns, and household formation rates could provide context for demand-side pressures.
- Economic Indicators: Including variables such as unemployment rates, wage growth, and monetary policy changes could improve the model's explanatory power.

2. Advanced Modeling Techniques

While linear regression provided a baseline, future research could benefit from:
- Machine learning models: Techniques like decision trees, random forests, or neural networks could capture complex, non-linear relationships between variables
- Time-Series Analysis: Models such as ARIMA, VAR, or LSTM could better account for temporal dependencies in the data.
- Causal Inference Methods: Approaches like instrumental variables or difference-in-differences could help disentagle causality from correlation.

3. Longer Time Horizons

Expanding the study period beyond a single decade could provide insights into longer-term trends and cyclical patterns in the housing market. For instance, including data from earlier housing crises or economic downturns might reveal how relationships between variables change under different market conditions.

4. Policy Impact Analysis

Investigating the role of government policies, such as interest rate changes by the Federal Reserve or housing subsidies, could add a valuable dimension to the analysis. For example:
- How do changes in mortgage interest deduction policies impact housing prices?
- What role do monetary and fiscal policies play in mitigating housing market volatility during economic crises?

5. Interactive Visualizations

Developing interactive dashboards or web-based tools to visualize the relationships between variables could make the findings more accessible to policymakers, researchers, and the general public. These tools could allow users to explore "what-if" scenarios, such as the impact of a hypothetical increase in mortgage rates or inflation on housing prices.

6. Exploring Global Comparisons

Comparing the U.S. housing market dynamics with those of other countries could offer a broader perspective. This could help identify unique aspects of the U.S. market or universal trends that apply across different economies.

### Broader Implications

This project highlighted the critical role of macroeconomic factors, particularly inflation, in shaping housing prices. However, the findings also underscored the complexity of the housing market, where numerous interdependent factors interact. Future work that integrates these elements could provide a more holistic understanding of housing market dynamics and inform better policy decisions.

### Conclusion

The lessons learned from this project and the outlined avenues for future work emphasize the importance of iterative, interdisciplinary research in understanding housing markets. By incorporating more data, employing advanced analytical methods, and addressing current limitations, future studies can build on these findings to offer deeper insights and practical recommendations for stakeholders in real estate, finance, and policymaking.
